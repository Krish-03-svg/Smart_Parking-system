# Smart_Parking-system
Smart Parking System using Arduino and Proteus is a simulated project where I wrote the control code in Arduino IDE and tested it using the Proteus simulation software. The system uses sensors to detect the presence of vehicles and displays real-time parking slot availability, aiming to reduce traffic and improve parking efficiency.
